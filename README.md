# Consistent Bayes Toolbox

This library is meant to provide a straightforward implementation of the Consistent Bayesian framework for solving Stochastic Inverse Problems.

--- 
## Installation Instructions

execute `python setup.py install` in the main ConsistentBayes directory to install all dependencies.

You can verify that everything is working as expected by executing the unit tests using the command `nosetests`. 

**Please make sure to run this before making any commits.**

## Getting Started
see the `examples/` directory for both script and jupyter-notebook files that walk you through how to solve stochastic inverse problems in the Consistent Bayesian framework, developed in tandem by:
- Dr. Troy Butler, CU Denver Dept. of Mathematics & Statistical Sciences
- Dr. Timothy Wildey, Sandia National Laboratories
- Dr. Scott Walsh, and
- Michael Pilosov, MS, CU Denver Dept. of Mathematics & Statistical Sciences

You can find general overview in the explanations presented in the jupyter notebooks.
