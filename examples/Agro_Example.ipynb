    "Suppose we have an acre of land and we are trying to decide what to plant on it. To keep this example really simple, we keep our decisions limited to just two crops: corn and soy. \n",

    "We will explore how the uncertainty in crop yields affects our decision about what to plant. Our main objective is to maximize profit. \n",

    "There may very well be uncertainty in the price for each crop, but for the purposes of an initial example, we treat these quantities as if they were known/fixed (I do believe that contracts can be purchased for fixed prices ahead of time, so this may not be such a strong assumption). \n",
    "\n",
    "We can explore the effect of price uncertainty on our decision making as well, but for clarity and easier results visualization, we leave that for future exploration.\n",
